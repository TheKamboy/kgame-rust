This is just a small project I&rsquo;m working on and may become something in the future.

It&rsquo;s based on a game me and my older brother (Keegan) would play outside when I was younger.

# How to Play

You have 2 options on how to play.


<a id="org4a515d8"></a>

## Option 1

Go into [Releases](https://github.com/TheKamboy/kgame-rust/releases), then select the version you want.
Later on I will add more builds for different systems.


<a id="org6d73fe4"></a>

## Option 2

Make sure you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed before doing this option.

1.  Clone the source code by running this command: `git clone https://github.com/TheKamboy/kgame-rust.git`
2.  Check Cargo.toml to make sure the packages are correct. (ex: Windows should have `ncurses-rs` commented and `pdcurses-sys` uncommented, Linux should have `pdcurses` commented, and `ncurses-rs` uncommented.)
3.  Run the command `cargo run` and see if it will build completely.
