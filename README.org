WARNING: This project is in a =ALPHA= state and may not work as intended.
Packages may get changed based on where I'm working on this (ex: Windows, Linux)

* Info
This is just a small project I'm working on and may become something in the future.

It's based on a game me and my older brother (Keegan) would play outside when I was younger.
* How to Play
You have 2 options on how to play.

** Option 1
Go into [[https://github.com/TheKamboy/kgame-rust/releases][Releases]], then select the version you want.
Later on I will add more builds for different systems.
** Option 2
Make sure you have [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust]] installed before doing this option.

1) Clone the source code by running this command: ~git clone https://github.com/TheKamboy/kgame-rust.git~
2) Check Cargo.toml to make sure the packages are correct. (ex: Windows should have ~ncurses-rs~ commented and ~pdcurses-sys~ uncommented, Linux should have ~pdcurses~ commented, and ~ncurses-rs~ uncommented.)
3) Run the command ~cargo run~ and see if it will build completely.

* Code Info
