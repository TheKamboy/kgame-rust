* I'm back to rust
I think I know what to do and other programming languages doesn't have the ncurses rust does so I'm back to this version.

* Keegan's Game (kgame)
WARNING: This project is in a =ALPHA= state and may not work as intended.
Looks like also the ncurses crate has issues but nothing I can do about it.

** Info
This is just a small project I'm working on and may become something in the future.

It's based on a game me and my older brother (Keegan) would play outside when I was younger.
